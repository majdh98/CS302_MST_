Please change the path in Driver.py and Time_Complexity.py to where the test files are stored in your computer. As an example,
the path is assigned to a valid string path.

We used the python library matplotlib for plotting time complexity comparison in Time_Complexity.py. To install, please 
type the following command in the terminal: pip install matplotlib. You must exit each figure for the next figure 
to be displayed. As an alternative to installing the library and to avoid having to exit every figure, we ran the program
in a Jupiter notebook (Time_Complexity.ipynb) which allowed to display graphs and make annotations in a visual friendly way.
To avoid having to install the Jupiter notebook framework, we saved Time_Complexity.ipynb into a pdf (Time_Complexity.pdf).
Having said all of this, Time_Complexity.py contains all the code necessary to generate all the graphs in 
Time_Complexity.ipynb.
